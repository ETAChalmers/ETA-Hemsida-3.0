## What you need
First you need ...git... and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed. Hugo is a static website generator. That is, a tool to simplify development. 
It makes it easier to reuse code, structure content and optimizes the website for deployment.

## Getting it running on your local machine
1. In the terminal, go to the project root.
2. Then enter `hugo server -D --bind="0.0.0.0"`
3. Now connect to the website
    * From your local machine: http://localhost:1313/
    * From a device on your local network. Your phone for example: http://*your_ip_address*:1313/	(Example: http://192.168.1.226:1313/)
