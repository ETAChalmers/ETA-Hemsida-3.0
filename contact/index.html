  <p>position: fixed;</p>

<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.</p>

<p>A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>

<p>Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:
Example
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
This <div> element has position: fixed;
position: absolute;</p>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>

<p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>

<p>Note: A &ldquo;positioned&rdquo; element is one whose position is anything except static.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:
This <div> element has position: relative;
This <div> element has position: absolute;</p>
